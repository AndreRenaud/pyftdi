EEPROM Management
-----------------

.. warning::
   Writing to the EEPROM can cause very **undesired** effects if the wrong
   value is written in the wrong place. You can even essentially **brick** your
   FTDI device. Use this function only with **extreme** caution.

   If using a Hi-Speed Mini Module and you brick for FTDI device, see
   FTDI_Recovery_
