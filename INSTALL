== Overview ==

Since PyUSB 1.0.0a2, USB bus enumeration can be performed without applying
any patch.

== Installation ==
 * Download pyusb-1.0.0a2
 * Install pyusb
 * Install pyftdi

= Serial port emulation, see serialext/tests/pyterm.py =

pip install virtualenv
virtualenv ~/.pyusb
# one out of the two following lines:
  ~/.pyusb/bin/pip install pyserial
  ~/.pyusb/bin/easy_install install pyserial
wget http://pypi.python.org/packages/source/p/pyusb/pyusb-1.0.0a2.tar.gz
tar xzvf pyusb-1.0.0a2.tar.gz
cd pyusb-1.0.0a2
 ~/.pyusb/bin/python setup.py install
PYTHONPATH=. ~/.pyusb/bin/python serialext/tests/pyterm.py -p ftdi:///?

Note that if there's only one FTDI device connected to the host, the FTDI URL
should be as simple as ftdi:///n, where n is the FTDI UART port (starting from 1)

= Troubleshooting =

 * "Error: No backend available":
  libusb native library cannot be loaded. Try helping the dynamic loader:
  * On Linux: export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=<path>
    where <path> is the directory containing the libusb-1.*.so library file
  * On Mac OS X: export DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH=.../lib
    where <path> is the directory containing the libusb-1.*.dylib library file
