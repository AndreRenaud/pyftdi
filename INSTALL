= General =

This version requires an extension to pyusb.
 * Download pyusb-1.0.0a1 
 * Apply the patch available from: https://gist.github.com/878301
 * Install pyusb
 * Install pyftdi

Support for USB bus and device information is expected to be part of the next
iteration of pyusb.

= Serial port emulation, see serialext/tests/pyterm.py =

pip install virtualenv
virtualenv ~/.pyusb
~/.pyusb/bin/python pip install pyserial
wget http://pypi.python.org/packages/source/p/pyusb/pyusb-1.0.0-a1.zip
unzip pyusb-1.0.0-a1.zip
cd .../pyusb-1.0.0-a1 
wget -O - https://gist.github.com/raw/878301/4e750cb913fd4979a76fbd3286615bce7517c264/pyusb-1.0.0a1-usbbus.patch | patch -p1
 ~/.pyusb/bin/python setup.py install
PYTHONPATH=. ~/.pyusb/bin/python serialext/tests/pyterm.py -p ftdi:///?

Note that if there's only one FTDI device connected to the host, the FTDI URL 
should be as simple as ftdi:///n, where n is the FTDI UART port (starting from 1)

= Troubleshooting =

 * "Error: No backend available":
  libusb native library cannot be loaded. Try helping the dynamic loader:
  * On Linux: export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=<path>
    where <path> is the directory containing the libusb-1.*.so library file
  * On Mac OS X: export DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH=.../lib
    where <path> is the directory containing the libusb-1.*.dylib library file
